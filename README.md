# Movie-Booking-System
Project for LING 530G

The booking system will allow users to sign up, sign in, log out, and purchase tickets. We’ll be storing data in SQLite. When purchasing the tickets, the system will first return a list of all available genres and the user will choose a genre, then the name of the movie, choose their preferred time slot, seat and the number of tickets they would like to buy. When the user has successfully purchased a ticket, there will be a summary of the user’s ticket order on the screen and our system will then send out a confirmation email. The user can view the purchased tickets as well.
